I've been thinking a lot about my early adult life and all of the challenges that I had to go through. I think that my specific lifestyle and way of dealing with stress had a lot to do with some negative or maybe maladaptive personality traits and behaviors that I feel that I have picked up.

(Read: Using reddit, 4chan, tumblr as an early teenager. TERRIBLE idea. It sucked. Also, my dad passing away in the worst way, didn't help.)

I think a lot of young people who are " terminally online" as my friend David put it, have had a mix of too much access to the internet, isolation, and repression of some negative event, or emotion or feeling.

I've been reflecting on this for a number of reasons, one being that I realize my use of Twitter is to fill a social hole, and also to have something to do on lunch breaks, lol. But really, I don't think I used Twitter in a healthy way and I think it's very difficult to achieve that.

I think that social media is complicated and a lot of people can get sucked into unfulfilling ways of interacting with it.

I made some decisions I regret in 2019, 2020, and 2021. I also had to deal with my mother passing away around 2018 to 2019. I'm still processing that. I took a walk in the State Forest and started meditating on my life while listening to some music (Stimulacrum by Dalmatrix). I just started bawling out of nowhere because, for an instant, I realized that I have established myself as a professional and I think I have a lot of fears related to that.

I spend so much time worrying about how smart I look or how good I perform in my job. It's really negative and it doesn't serve me well. There's no reason for me to worry so much every day.

Performance evaluations are coming up and I really think I did fantastic. I worked with multiple different business lines to drive integration of a code scanning pipeline. I'm the only person who has been contributing code and infrastructure to the code scanning Pipeline on my team for 8 months. That's not to say my team hasn't been working hard, but we really need a team of three people and a product owner and an agile resource to make this pipeline REALLY successful. It's just been me so far.

In addition to that, I've worked on documentation for controls and governance as well as learning Helm and kubernetes in only a few months. I did so much extra stuff this year and I really think I'm going to get at least a 10K pay bump.

And this is why it (my obsession with being regarded highly/workaholicism) is ridiculous!!!!

Despite all of that AWESOME work, I still feel so compelled to work overtime and do things that take an extremely large amount of energy from me. It's affecting the way that I talk to my family because I'm impatient and everything is rushed. I don't know if they notice it but I definitely notice it. It's just terrible to work so hard that it starts to mess with your personal life. This is a personal flaw that I have.

I don't know how to relax, I have focus issues, and I get distracted easily. I really think that I have issues planning and sometimes it feels like there's a hole in my ability to think...

I sometimes wonder if I should get back on ADHD medicine. I can function okay at my job but I really need help focusing and with executive function. It's gotten to the point where I usually don't know what month it is and certainly not the calendar year. I never really cared about dates anyways, and I might be making it sound a little worse than it is.

It's all of these little things though. If I get stuck on something at work and might need to talk to somebody else, instead of actually doing that, I will find something to distract myself with like twirling my hair or cleaning my desk. This happens for one minute and then I will find another thing to distract myself with. This slow unraveling of my focus, literally taking what I was thinking about and slowly pushing it away, happens without me even realizing it.

I'm so used to just getting stuck on something very small at work, stimming or distracting myself like tapping my foot or sweeping stuff off my desk, and then doing something even more distracting like getting a coffee or making a piece of toast. It's harmless to take short breaks but I genuinely don't feel like I'm in control of my attention span. I didn't even know today was Thanksgiving until 3:00 p.m. yesterday when I looked at my calendar and realized that all of the meetings were canceled.

Maybe I should get on a low dose of Methylphenidate. I think it could help me focus at work.

Or maybe I shouldn't. 

The whole point of this rant was that I am an overachiever gifted child that grew up and now he's 25 and he has image issues or some perverse drive to self-sacrifice all of his free time just so that he can get great things said about him on his performance evaluation. It might not be worth it then to medicate myself for something I've been diagnosed with which I probably have by the definition of whoever makes up the definition of ADHD. 

But why should I medicate myself just so that I can reinforce a habit that stems from a self-image or some sort of psychological issue. It's definitely more complicated than just fixing my ADHD by medicating me because it could just encourage me to work over work and get burnt out but I think I could genuinely do a lot better if I did treat my ADHD so I might just see if I can get it treated and see if it helps me with focus at work.

I did do fantastic at school when I had my ADHD medicated.

All of the ADHD articles by the way that say that ADHD is something that also affects the limbic system and the sympathetic nervous system are right.

The only way to get me to really attack a task is by scaring me into thinking there's a deadline or some sort of other impending negative event. Everything else doesn't interest us (ADHD people) enough to get us to do it. Unless it's something that I love like programming.

I'm pretty glad I started journaling when I'm stressed. I end up having internal dialogues that I never have otherwise.

(Finished eating thanksgiving dinner with my family)

I think that going to Midwest FurFest in 2022 (in 1 week) is going to be an interesting reflection on myself. It'll be fun, for sure, but also just...hopefully give me time to think about the way I spend my time using social media. It's definitely a net negative.

But...I'm sick of ranting. Time to make this Unity Game demo for a tutoring lesson.
