I feel really angry today and upset. Yesterday I was working on my homework and almost finished part of a lab where you are meant to poison the ARP cache to execute a man in the middle attack. I realize just how short my attention span is and how I kept reopening Twitter and looking at Etsy for cute hats and looking at memes instead of actually working on the homework. I would read part of the homework, and then think about it for probably 10 seconds, and then I would waste 5 minutes looking at cute hats or memes or twitter.

It didn't even strike me what I was doing then. I'm mad because of how short my attention span is and how I think I've been wasting massive amounts of time because of it. I'm thinking about how I've been working at US Bank for 3 years and doing genuinely good work, but how much **better** it could be and how much easier my job would be if I could **focus properly**.

I am really glad that I'm able to think about this now. Sometimes I feel completely out of control of my own brain. I feel like that movie where the person has Amnesia and realizes it over and over again everyday, because they only have 24 hours to remember, so they have to make a bunch of hints for them to realize it faster the next day. It's sort of like encoding information in a different place other than the long-term memory.

ADHD SUCKS. Keeping on task for more than one minute is so difficult and I just want to be able to focus. I'm definitely going to get my methylphenidate prescription refilled when I go back to chicago.
