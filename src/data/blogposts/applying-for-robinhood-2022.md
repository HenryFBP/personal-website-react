Well, I got rejected from Robin Hood. I can reapply in 6 months.

I was going to work as a Infrastructure Security Engineer.

But, I didn't do good enough at the coding portion.

Everything else - team fit, infrastructure design, etc; was fine.

I'm pretty tired, so I will update this later in the morning.
