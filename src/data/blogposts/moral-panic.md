I can't deal with the news I'm so sick of hearing about the moral panic that's happening today. The LGBT grooming thing is pretty insane. I really just don't engage with it and don't read about it because it makes me so tired. 

So...what if Midwest FurFest 2022 gets shot up because someone decides furries are all pedos? Why do I even have to think about this potentiality?

I really think that if you're a concerned conservative there's very few places to get information on what the hell "Drag Queen Story Hour" is or even what most LGBT people want from life.

I really can't see this resolving without some sort of cultural shift towards positive communication between different groups.

But I don't even... I can't... I can't even fix any of this stuff. I just try to avoid thinking about it because it makes me so angry and I feel powerless to do anything.

I really think the resolution to this at least for me is just to stop thinking about it and avoid it as much as possible. I have no idea how people can enthusiastically interact with the social issues that are plaguing our country. It just makes me so exhausted because makes me really sad and angry and I feel totally powerless.

...

Not to mention the debt, ukraine, russia, china, etc. Too much stuff to think about.
